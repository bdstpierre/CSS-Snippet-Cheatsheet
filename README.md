## Installation
This webpage does not rely on any other files or resources other than provided in this repository.
## Usage

The website is setup to be responsive to device size.  If the user is on a computer or other device with a screen width of 992 pixels or greater, they will see three snippets on a row.

If the user is on a tablet or other device with a screen width smaller than 992 pixels but at least 768 pixels wide, they will see two snippets per row.

Finally, if the user is on a phone or other device with a screen width smaller than 768 pixels wide, they will see one snippet per row.

The snippets are setup so that when the user clicks on one, the text is selected and ready to be copied and then pasted into their own CSS code.

## Credits
